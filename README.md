MATLAB PROGRAMS and SIMULINK
This repository contains the simulink models and programs-

->Transformers efficiency code with efficiency curve
->Particle swarm optimization(PSO) with modified PSO equation which is proved to perform better on some MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS like Sphere function etc.

->SERIES RLC simulation using MATLAB simulink
